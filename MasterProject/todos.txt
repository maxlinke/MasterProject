- run a bunch of games of ttt with the two agent variants and see if it actually works what i've built so far
	- only when i have the game tree agent (who should never lose) will i see if it actually works
	  because it's a little suspect that the line builder performs so bad when he's player two

- a way to run a lot of games and get the results
- a start of the web-visualizer (can i easily read a bunch of files?)
	- i think i can just put the .json things as scripts into the main visualizer script then it's automatic
	- how does that break if those scripts get removed?
	- check how we did it in visualization
- the datasaver
	- agent rankings
		- elo for two players is easy, how does it work for multiple player rounds?
		- for visualization it'd be nice if the elo was trackable too
			- where to save that? i think gamerecords would be best
			- because they have a timestamp and an agent id already
			- rather than keeping elo with just the agents which might make elo over time graphing harder
	- the "database"?
	- could make it so all data is just cached and manually has to be written
	- with an automatic write on program exit
- ranked and unranked games
- automatically shuffling the agent orders around
	- random is simple
	- how many different games would there need to be if we tried to get perfect coverage?
		- is that even necessary, considering the random nature of some agents?
		- in the end, with rankings it'll average out anyways
