        // at the very least, don't make it an enum
        // so it becomes possible to add more types
        // i mean, the generation + individual approach is pretty specific already
        // because some machine learning is just "one" agent that "learns", right?
        // OR i just say fuck it and make genetic algorithms this framework's definition of machine learning
